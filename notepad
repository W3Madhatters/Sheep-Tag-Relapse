Sheep Tag Rush
--------------
Shepherds spawn 5 seconds after sheep
10-15 gray farms per sheep are created in mapgrid
Every 5 seconds, up to 3 gray farms are made per sheep
If there are greater than 60 + 15 * sheep farms, the first (player made maybe?) farms are destroyed
When a sheep dies, they swap with the killing shepherd (a new shepherd spawns in the middle, a new sheep replaces the killing shepherd, and gets invulnerability for 10 seconds)
